# Design and Prototype of a Miniature-Androgynous-Docking-Mechanism-for-CubeSats
Independent Research Project to design, simulate, and prototype a miniature docking ring for 3Uâ€“6U CubeSats, inspired by the International Docking System Standard (IDSS).

## Project Overview
The project focuses on creating a **CubeSat-scale docking mechanism** with the following goals:
- Androgynous design: Both docking interfaces are identical.
- Self-alignment during docking using a **soft capture system** (guidance funnels).
- Secure **hard capture via latches** to ensure mechanical engagement.
- Validation of design using **CAD modeling, FEA analysis, and prototype testing**.

The project demonstrates the full workflow of **space mechanism design**: from literature review to CAD, simulation, and physical prototyping.
