# Design and Prototype of a Miniature-Androgynous-Docking-Mechanism-for-CubeSats
Independent Research Project to design, simulate, and prototype a miniature docking ring for 3Uâ€“6U CubeSats, inspired by the International Docking System Standard (IDSS).

## Project Overview
The project focuses on creating a **CubeSat-scale docking mechanism** with the following goals:
- Androgynous design: Both docking interfaces are identical.
- Self-alignment during docking using a **soft capture system** (guidance funnels).
- Secure **hard capture via latches** to ensure mechanical engagement.
- Validation of design using **CAD modeling, FEA analysis, and prototype testing**.

The project demonstrates the full workflow of **space mechanism design**: from literature review to CAD, simulation, and physical prototyping.

## Objectives
1. Study existing docking standards (IDSS) and CubeSat-scale adaptations.
2. Design a miniature androgynous docking ring in **SolidWorks**.
3. Validate structural integrity, alignment, and latch functionality via **ANSYS FEA**.
4. Build a **3D-printed prototype** to demonstrate docking feasibility.
5. Document the project as a technical report suitable for aerospace projects.
